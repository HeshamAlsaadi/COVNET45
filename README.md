The algorithm performs sorting and matching by swapping elements for traceroute navigation based on key pattern regression.

The implementation contains two processes of **iteration** and **extraction** on each virtual list of elements demonstrated as follow:

* `delta1`:`(L) is the number of each virtual list value in a giving log file`.
* `delta2`:`Breaking each value into L/2 of vlist in a giving log file`.
